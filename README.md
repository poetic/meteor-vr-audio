# Web Audio Api and Meteor VR

* I forked and added an audio listener to the poetic-vr-boilerplate package. 

* If you want to check this out, use the [forked package](https://github.com/RealLukeMartin/poetic-vr-boilerplate) by making sure it's in the packages/ directory and change the `name` in package.js to `reallukemartin:vrboiler-plate`
